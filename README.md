# TSNE-t-distributed-stochastic-neigbor-embedding
## Content
1)pdf file contain the explaination and notes on t-sne -what is it,why t-sne and not pca,Gaussian distribution,how tsne works(the steps),situation when cluster is spread
similarity scores with example,conditional probability,create low dimentional space,loss function,gradient decscent,kullback leibler divergence,with explaination,student 
t-distribution <br />
2).csv file is our dataset that which we will work on the dataset is all about cancer dataset where m is cancer paitent and v is not cancer paitent <br />
3)t_SNE_t_distributed_stochastic_neigbor_embedding.ipynb contain hands on tsne algorithm  that which we perform on cancer dataset <br />
4)tsne_2d.png is our output that we made higher dimension to lower dimension
